    <h3>An Overview on Speed Cameras in NYC</h3>
</p> Speed cameras have been a hot topic in New York City. Various advocacy groups 
from Transportation Alternatives to Families for Safe Streets have been asking for reforms to
ensure public safety. This past summer, Governor Hochul signed a bill which requires speed 
cameras to be on 24/7. Currently, there are approximately 750 cameras citywide, and drivers who exceed 
10 mph over the speed limit are charged a $50 fine. As part of the legislation, speed cameras 
must be within a 1,320-foot radius of a school entrance or exit. And lastly, the installation 
of the cameras has generated controversy â€” some believe the measures do not go far enough, 
some believe it is a cash grab.</p>
