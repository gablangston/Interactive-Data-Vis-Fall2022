## NOTES

-----------
For this tutorial, I utilized a variety of guides, but mainly Matt Layman's 
A "simple" D3.js area chart: https://www.mattlayman.com/blog/2015/d3js-area-chart/
and d3noob's Simple graph with filled area in v7: 
https://bl.ocks.org/d3noob/09d3a1416d4c5c9da6eb1c7e63efff9d'.

The place where I am stuck is producing the actual graph. I've doubled check the js
and css files to ensure that the line and areas are defined, but unfortunately I am 
unable to produce a graph.

I ensured to leave comments throughout the js file, but am stumped as to what
I'm missing.
