## NOTES

-----------
In this tutorial, I attempted to use the environmental ratings json file 
provided. The three variables I wanted to focus on are: ideologyScore2020, 
envScore2020 and envScoreLifetime.

I wanted to visualize if there is a correlation between the 2020 ideology score
(x axis) and the lifetime environmental score (y axis) with the size of the dots
being the 2020 environmental score.

Unfortunately I am only able to visualize the x axis and after troubleshooting 
both the js and css files, can't figure out what I am missing.
